I see you're curious, and wonder what this is folder is for.
This folder is for test commands and older versions of commands.
There will not be ALL older commands because some may have issues/bugs.
If you wan't to help with the contribution to me and help find bugs go to [github of extra commands]


and just incase the commands get broken. probably ls copy this into the top folder.
